# Who Am I

i am just some random guy you found on the internet mate xd. anyway im a *soon* to be college student studying Digital Media. everything else i hated back in high school except cooking (mostly because i get free food xd). i do a bit of art, mostly graffiti or manga sketches (yes im a weeb) you can find some of my work on my YT channel or my newly created instagram account

Languages:

        • Batch (know the most)

        • JavaScript (eh getting there. started recently)
        
        • Python (started recently in college. barely know anything tho xd)
       
       
i started learning JavaScript a few months ago after talking to one of my mates, also known as a beat saber modder named HenWill and he suggested me to use Khan Academy as i want to learn how to make beat saber mods but theres no free (easily accesable) C++ teaching tools and apparently JavaScript is close to C++ so im giving it a go. so henwill if this works i cant thank you enough mate xd.

anyway thats it. idfk what else to put here as i havnt had much coding experience apart from making some adb batch file for quest known as QuestToolBox that i worked on with a friend
